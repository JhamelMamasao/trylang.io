            <p>
                I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how lucky I am to have you in my life. It’s still so new, but every moment with you feels so special, like we’re writing the first pages of a beautiful story together.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love the way we can talk about anything, how your smile lights up even the simplest days, and how just being with you makes everything feel right. You bring so much joy and warmth to my life that it’s hard to put into words just how much I appreciate you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can’t wait to see where this journey takes us, to create more memories and share more laughter together. You’re already such an important part of my world, and I’m so excited for all the things we’ll discover about each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for being you, and for allowing me to be part of your life. I promise to cherish every moment with you, support you, and make you feel as special as you make me feel every single day.
            </p>
